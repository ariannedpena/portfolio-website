                <h2> Aspiring Full Stack Developer</h2>
                <p>I am a province girl from the southernmost part of the Philippines, General Santos City who came to Metro Manila looking for better opportunities.
                    I am working here now for 3 years as an Accounts Payable Associate, as of April 2020. I started as a project based employee, 
                    absorbed by the company after 5 months, and promoted to a senior level last March 2020.
                    As a graduate of BS Information Technology, working in a Finance department is really hard for me at first but I took it as a challenge and 
                    work hard to excel in my current field. 
                    Equipped with my programming background in college, I am excited and confident that I can complete the project. 
                    I have been successful to juggle developing this project while performing my responsibilities as Accounts Payable Associate. Mostly I always
                     spend extra hours in our house doing the project. I so excited to complete the project.
                </p>

                <p>Basically, the project is develop an Excel based VBA application we called AP Dispute Tracker. Mainly, this application will have 3 functions it is to: Add Dispute, Edit/View Dispute, and Report Extraction. This will automate the manual process of tracking of dispute for Accounts Payable with aim to eliminate the errors an incorrectness data entered by setting multiple specific parameters and conditions. This comes with manual in a PDF, MP4 format. We are currently using the application for six months. I have been awarded for the accomplishment of this project as “Employee of the Quarter” for quarter 2 of 2019
                    Currently, I am taking an online course about Python Web Development in Udemy. I am looking forward to complete this very soon and able to utilize the skills/knowledge I have gain in developing real world projects.
